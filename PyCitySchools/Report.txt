I have summarised a few summaries listed below using the test results provided. 
Please refer to 'Analysed_test_result.txt' for the summarised data.

In this analysis, a total of 15 schools are analysised with a total of 39,170 students. It can be seen that the average maths 
score is at 70.34, while the average reading score is at 69.98. the rate passing in both subjects is at 72.81%. 

Looking at the performance of each school, Griffin and Cabrera High School have the best rate of passing both 
subjects (81.34% and 80.79%, respectively) while Hernandez and Huang High School being the worst (66.36% and 66.71%, respectively). 
Now, lets look at both school in details: 

Griffin High School:   {School type: Independent, Total student: 1468, Per student budget: $625.00, % overall passing: 81.34%}
Cabrera High School:   {School type: Independent, Total student: 1858, Per student budget: $582.00, % overall passing: 80.79%}
Hernandez High School: {School type: Government,  Total student: 4635, Per student budget: $652.00, % overall passing: 66.36%}
Huang High School:     {School type: Government,  Total student: 2917, Per student budget: $655.00, % overall passing: 66.71%}

Considering the Spending_summary, the rate of 'overall passing' is the highest (79.88%) when the spending ranges (per student) 
is between $585-630. This is reflected in the two top schools. On the other hand, the rate of 'overall passing' is the 
lowest (66.76%) when the spending ranges (per student) is between $645-680. This is, also, reflected in the two bottom schools. 

Considering the Size_summary, the rate of 'overall passing' is the highest (79.07%) when the school size is >1000. 
This isn't reflected in the two top schools. However, the rate of 'overall passing' is the lowest (70.29%) when the 
school size is between 2000-5000, and this is reflected in the two bottom schools. 

Considering the Type_summary, the rate of 'overall passing' is the highest (76.97%) when the school is run independantly, 
which is reflected in the two top schools. On the other hand, the rate of 'overall passing' is the lowest (70.70%) when 
the school is run by the Government, which is , too, reflected in the two bottom schools. 

Drawing from the insights above, it can be concluded that, firstly, spending more per student does not mean a result of 
better performance, spending between $585-630 per student would be optimal for the best performance outcome. 
Secondly, having a smaller school size doesn't not necessarily mean a better performance, as the 2 top schools have more 
than 1000 students. However, having a larger number of student (>2000) is shown likely to have a poorer performance. 
Thirdly, beining in the independant schools hold a greater chance of performing better than being in the Government schools.
